# Capstone-Final-Project
Python Program - QGIS


Thorough project management:



1)  Install and explore QGIS: Download and install QGIS from the official website (https://www.qgis.org/) if you haven't already. Familiarize yourself with its interface and basic operations by following tutorials and user guides.

2)  Research Python libraries: Learn about relevant Python libraries, such as PyQGIS, Pandas, and Geopandas, which will help you interact with QGIS, import and manipulate CSV and shapefile data, and perform GIS operations.

3)  Design the GUI: Sketch out a simple and user-friendly design for your GUI. You can use a pen and paper or a digital design tool. Consider which features you want to include, such as buttons for importing files, options for data manipulation, and visualization tools.

4)  Choose a GUI library: Research and choose a suitable Python library for creating the GUI. Some popular options are PyQt, Tkinter, and Kivy. Pick one that works well with QGIS and fits your requirements.

5)  Learn the chosen GUI library: Familiarize yourself with the chosen GUI library by following tutorials and reading documentation. Practice creating simple applications to understand the basics.

6)  Set up your development environment: Set up your Python environment with the necessary libraries (PyQGIS, Pandas, Geopandas, and your chosen GUI library). Create a virtual environment if needed to keep your project dependencies separate from your system-wide Python packages.

7)  Implement file import functionality: Write code to import CSV and shapefile data using Pandas and Geopandas. Test this functionality to ensure that it can properly read and parse the input files.

8)  Implement data cleaning and manipulation: Develop functions to clean and manipulate the imported data as needed. This may include handling missing values, reprojecting coordinate systems, or filtering and aggregating data.

9)  Integrate with QGIS: Use PyQGIS to connect your Python script to QGIS. This will enable you to load the cleaned and manipulated data into QGIS for visualization.

10)  Implement visualization options: Develop features in your GUI that allow users to choose how they want to visualize the data in QGIS. This might include options for styling layers, changing map projections, or displaying specific attributes.

11)  Create the GUI: Use your chosen GUI library to build the interface, incorporating the file import, data manipulation, and visualization features you have developed. Ensure that the interface is user-friendly and well-organized.

12)  Test your application: Thoroughly test your application to identify and fix any bugs, ensuring that it works correctly and meets your project requirements.

13)  Document your work: Write clear and concise documentation for your project, including instructions for installation, usage, and any limitations or known issues.

14)  Present your project: Prepare a presentation to showcase your capstone project, including an overview of the problem it solves, the technologies used, a demonstration of its functionality, and any challenges you faced and lessons learned during development.
